<div class="header">
<p><font color="white" font size="5">The Kumbh Mela comprises of many rituals including bathing ritual, which by far is the most significant ritual performed at Kumbh.
Millions of pilgrims take part in the Kumbh bathing ritual at the Triveni Sangam.
Performing this sacred ceremony is in accordance with the belief that by submerging oneself in the holy waters,one is purged of all their sins, release themselves and their ancestors from the cycle of rebirth and ultimate attainment of Moksha. 
Along with the bathing ritual, the pilgrims also worship on the banks of the holy river and participate in discourses from various sadhus and saints.<br><br>
Although taking a dip in the sacred waters on all days of Prayagraj Kumbh beginning from Makar Sankranti 
(first day of the month of Magh, when the Sun enters Capricorn) is considered holy, yet there are some specific auspicious bathing dates.
 There are magnificent processions of saints and their disciples, and members of various Akharas (religious orders)
 take part in the ritual of Shahi Snan also known as ‘Rajyogi Snan’ at the start of Kumbh. 
Shahi Snan is the central highlight of Kumbh Mela and the most important part of the celebration. 
It is only after the Shahi Snan is complete, that people are allowed to take the holy bath,
in the belief that the people will get the added advantage of the essence of holy deeds and thoughts of the saints by taking the dip after them.
